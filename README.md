## About datav

Datav is a modern data visualization platform built from scratch in 2023, you can visualize metrics, traces, and logs from various datasource, and correlate them easily and deeply.

Datav has almost all the features that Grafana has, you may think it as a replacement of Grafana, but it doesn't.

Because, **Datav is focus in observability and APM scenarios**, however, Grafana is designed for general purpose data visualization.

## Compare to Grafana

Although Grafana is a great product, and it is the most popular dashboarding tool in the world, Datav has its own advantages.

1. **Datav provides native support for observability and APM**
  
    - **Built in Metrics, Traces and Logs panels**, they are all very very powerful
    - **Beautiful large screen support**, which looks like big data large screen
    - **Customize sidebar menu** to provice better navigation features
    - **Global variables** to provide global context: select in one place, effect everywhere, e.g applications, environments, hosts 
    - General HTTP datasource and Echarts panel, you can query and build everything you want with them 
    - Transform data to any format you want before rendering
  
    In a word, **you can use Datav to build any kinds of APM UI**! We provide you nearly all the tools you need. 

    As comparison, grafana is focusing on exploring data, which make it impossible to meet what APM and Observability really needs.

2. **Bountiful panel options**, comparing to Grafana, Datav provides much more panel settings for you to build your own powerful panel.
   
3. **Much better dashboard interactivity**, such as custom your own jumping events between traces, logs and metrics like below video:

4. **Outstanding performance and user experience**
   codebase in Datav are very clean and simple: we only use React.js and Vite.js and has taken a lot of optimizations to improve user experiences.

   **Datav is also much more easier to redevelop**, if you are a developers, when you dig into Grafana's codebase, you should know what I mean.
   
5. **Beautiful and customizable UI**

    As datav is a new product, we have a chance to build a modern and beautiful UI from scratch. 

    You can customize dashboard and panel styles to build beautiful dashboard, such as building a large screen display, maybe your Boss will like it :)

6.  **Better open-source License**

    Datav is using Apache License 2.0, which is more friendly to commercial use.

    We promise: **we will never CHANGE LICENSE and CLOSE-SOURCE in the future, datav is and will be 100% open source forever**!

7.  **Perfect mobile screeen support**: viewing and editing dashboards at home using your mobile phone.
