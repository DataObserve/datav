## What is datav
<p>Datav is a very new and modern data visualization platform, you can think it as a modern version of Grafana. </p>

<p>You can visualize metrics, traces, and logs from various datasource, and correlate them easily and deeply.</p>

<p>It sounds like Datav is much like Grafana , but it doesn't </p>

## Compare to Grafana

Grafana is a great product, and it is the most popular dashboarding tool in the world. But Datav has its own adavantages: 

1. Native support for observability
2. Much better panel interactions, such as custom your own jumping events between traces, logs and metrics, like the video below:

3.  Customize sidebar menu,  you can also use other team's sidebar
4.  Easier to use and redevelop
