## Datav

Datav provides excellent chart features and interactivity, allowing you to correlate traces, metrics, and logs, as well as enabling jumps and drill-downs. This can help engineers quickly pinpointing the root causes of production issues.

Comparing to other general-purpose data visualization platforms datav is mainly focus on Observability and APM. It offers a extremely wide range of features that empower you to create your custom Observability UI.

**You can build any Observability and APM ( Application Performance Management ) UI you want based on Datav, if you cannot, please file an issue and we will support it as soon as possible.**

## Quick start & Documentation

The documentation is available at [datav.io/docs](https://datav.io/docs).

 - **Built in general HTTP datasource and Echarts panel**, you can query and build anything you want with them.
 - **Powerful data transformation**, in some cases, the data query from datasource is not exactly what you want, for these cases you can customize the data transformation in Datav, and converted the query result into any format and form you want.

    In a word, you can use Datav to build any kinds of APM UI! We provide you nearly all the tools you need.

  

2. **Quick response and development of new features and bugs**

   Some products are constrained by its commercial product line, complex codebase and development process, therefore many features may take years to be responded, whereas Datav is always ready to support them as long as they're reasonable.

8.  **Perfect mobile screen support**

    There will always be times you need to access the APM platform outside the company's internal network, so supporting mobile operation is essential too.
