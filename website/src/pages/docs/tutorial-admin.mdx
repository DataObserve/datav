title: Admin is dangerous 
description: 
---

Do you still remember we are login with default `admin` user? The worse thing is that default password is `admin` too.

`admin` user in Datav has all privileges, the role of `admin` is `Super Admin`, other users can never set to this role.

As a result,  `admin` can do everthing , therefore, it's not safe to use `admin` user in production environment, it's event dangerous to use `admin` as password :(

So, let's start with changing password.

## Change password 

1. Click `user` icon in the bottom of sidebar and select `Account setting`.
2. Fill in the forms in `Change Password` section 
3. Click `Submit`

When you change password, you will be logout automatically, you need to login again with new password.

### I forget `admin` password 

If you forget `admin` password, you have to manually set it to `empty` in database, don't set to any other strings, as the password is encrypted. 

Once re-login `admin` with empty password, you must **change it to a new one for safety** !


## Create a new user 

Another way is to create a new user and assign him with `Admin` role.

1. Click `configuration` icon in the bottom of sidebar and select `User` tab

4. Click `Submit` button

Now, you can login with `datav-admin` and `datav-admin` password. This user can also manage datav as `admin` user.
