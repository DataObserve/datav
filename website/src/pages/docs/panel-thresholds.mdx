We can add thresholds to our charts to provide a marked line or area. This can be useful to indicate a warning level.

In this doc, we will continue using the panel created in last doc, and add a threshold to it: 

**If load1 or load5 value is great than 2, then we will show a warning line to indicate the user that the load is too high if it is greater than 1.**

## Add threshold to Graph panel 

Open panel editor of the panel we created in last doc, and find the `Thresholds` section in `Panel` tab.
