If you are the `Admin` of `Datav`, sometimes you may want to arrange some dashboards at the top of the `search modal`, such as the dashboard represent the new features of Datav.

You can set the `sort priority` of the dashboard to achieve this.

> Only the `Admin` of `Datav` can modify the sort priority of dashboard.

## Set sort priority
Now let's set the sort priority for `Host info` dashboard to make it be shown at the top of search modal.

Here is a image of the current sort orders:

`Host info` is at the 3th place in the list. Let's modify its sort priority: click the `0` number which the arrow points to in the image

## Final result

Set the new priority to 50 and press `Enter` to save it, now you should see the sort order has been changed:
