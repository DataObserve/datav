## Filter

There is a toolbox in the top left corner of `NodeGraph`, the most useful one is the fitler tool. You can use it to filter the nodes and edges you want.

In above image, we set a filter rule to match `node-1` and `node-2` nodes.

If you want see the relation nodes of them, check `Show realtion`:

### Enable/disalbe 

The filter rules you set is automatically store in browser local storage, if you don't need them, you can remove or just disable them:

<img src="https://github.com/data-observe/assets/blob/main/plugin/enable-filter.jpg?raw=true" />

You can see that when we disalbed the rule by clicking the `eye icon`, all the nodes and edges are shown now.


## Donut colors

Nodes in `NodeGraph` panel are all render in <Code>Donut</Code> shapes, you can define own colors for them.

Let's assume your [node data format](/docs/panel-data-transform#nodegraph-format) is like this: 

```json
"data": {
    "success": 72,
    "error": 28
}
```

Then you can set donut colors as below:

And the result is:

## Table View

Sometimes, dependency data in table format is very useful, for how to change view between NodeGraph and Table panel, please refer to [Conditional rendering](/docs/panel-conditional-rendering).
