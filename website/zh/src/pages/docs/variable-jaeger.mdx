In this doc, let's see how to query variables from <Code>Jaeger</Code>.

As a result, we should select jaeger services like this in Jaeger UI:

> Before start, you should have a <Code>Jaeger</Code> instance running, refer to https://www.jaegertracing.io/ for more info.

## Jaeger services 

Services can be useful in many dashboards, such as `Application info`, `hosts info`, `JVM info`, `SQL stats` etc, it is the core object for a monitoring system.

So we should create it as a `Global Variable`.

1. Click `configuration icon` in the bottom section of sidebar and select `Variable` tab.
2. Create a new global variable with name `services` as below:

Click `Submit` and go to a dashboard, you should see a variable dropdown list as below:

Exactly the same as services in Jaeger UI.

## Jaeger operations

Operations are the next level of services, its creation step is similar to services: 

<img src="https://github.com/data-observe/assets/blob/main/variable/edit-jaeger-operations.jpg?raw=true" style={{height: "500px"}}/>

The only difference is that you should select a service in `Service` dropdown list, and variable is supported, so we use <Code>{'${services}'}</Code> here to refer to the `services` variable created in last section.

## Final result 

<video controls autoPlay src="https://github.com/data-observe/assets/blob/main/variable/jaeger-final.mov?raw=true" style={{height: "500px"}}/>

Here you can see, when we select a service, the dropdown list of  `operation` variable will be updated automatically, at the same time the traces will be updated as well.
