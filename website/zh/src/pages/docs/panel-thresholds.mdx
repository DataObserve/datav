We can add thresholds to our charts to provide a marked line or area. This can be useful to indicate a warning level.

In this doc, we will continue using the panel created in last doc, and add a threshold to it: 

**If load1 or load5 value is great than 2, then we will show a warning line to indicate the user that the load is too high if it is greater than 1.**

## Add threshold to Graph panel 

Open panel editor of the panel we created in last doc, and find the `Thresholds` section in `Panel` tab.

Fill in the `Thresholds` section as above, you can see there is a warning line add to the chart. That's easy and intuitive.

But there is a big problem, this threshold only works for `node_load5` series, if we want to add the same threshold to `node_load1` series, we have to find another way.

## Add threshold to `node_load1` series 

To add threshold to `node_load1` series, we have to set a override rule.

Add a override like below:

## Final result 

Let's have a look at what the final chart looks like:
