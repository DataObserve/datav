We have talked about dashboard <Code>meta data</Code> in [tutorial](/docs/tutorial-team#dashboard-meta-data). 

Therefore you should already know that you can change dashboard settings by modify meta data. 

But a more common use case for meta data is to import a dashboard.

## Copy meta data 

Let's open the setting modal of `Home` dashboard and select `Meta data` tab.

![dashboard metadata](https://github.com/data-observe/assets/blob/main/dashboard/metadata.jpg?raw=true)

Then copy these meta data of JSON format.

## Import dashboard

1. Click `+` icon in the bottom section of sidebar
2. Select `Import dashboard` tab 
3. Paste the meta data you copied into `Meta JSON` field 
4. Select the team you want to import this dashboard to

![import dashboard](https://github.com/data-observe/assets/blob/main/dashboard/import.jpg?raw=true)

You can modify meta data before imported, such as rename the title from `Home Dashboard` to <Code>  "title": "A imported dashboard" </Code>.

Click `Submit` button to see the result.


## What has changed?

When a dashboard is imported, what has changed when compared to the original dashboard?

The answer is dashboard id:  <Code>d-home</Code> -> <Code>d-c52NkURSz</Code>.

Therefore the imported dashboard and the original dashboard are two different dashboards, although the looks exactly the same.
